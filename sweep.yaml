description: "daily-summary/daily_summary is a python 3.10 project. The main function is in daily-summary/daily_summary/main.py. All code should be written in the main.py file. Write unit tests in the tests directory as their corresponding code, i.e. daily-summary/tests/main_test.py tests daily-summary/daily_summary/main.py. We use pytest for tests. Use list and tuple for typing instead of typing.List and typing.Tuple."

rules:
  - "There should be no debug log or print statements in production code."
  - "All functions should have parameters and output annotated with type hints. Use list, tuple and dict instead of typing.List, typing.Tuple and typing.dict."
  - "Leftover TODOs in the code should be handled."
  - "All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests in the tests directory. For example, daily-summary/tests/main_test.py tests daily-summary/daily_summary/main.py. Use unittest and unittest.mock as required."
  - "Any clearly inefficient or repeated code should be optimized or refactored."
  - "Remove any comments before code that are obvious. For example `# this prints hello world; print('hello world')`."
