Your day in review:

Today, there were several key changes made in the code.

In the first commit, the code that checks if the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set has been moved to a separate function called `check_env()`. Additionally, a new test file `test_main.py` has been added, which contains a unit test `test_openai_api_key_not_set()` to test the behavior of the `check_env()` function when the environment variable is not set.

In the second commit, the code in the `main()` function that checked for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and displayed an error message has been moved to a new function called `check_env()`. The `test_example.py` file has been deleted, and the `test_main.py` file has been renamed `test_main.py`, with its import statements updated accordingly. The call to `main()` in the test function has been replaced with a call to `check_env()`.

Lastly, in the third commit, several changes were made to the "sweep.yaml" configuration file. The "branch" setting was changed to "main", the "gha_enabled" setting was set to True, and the "blocked_dirs" setting was removed. The "description" setting was updated with a more specific description of the project. The "draft" setting was changed to False. A "rules" section was added, containing a list of rules that Sweep will check for, including requirements related to debug statements, type hinting, handling TODOs, unit tests, code optimization, and removing unnecessary comments.

Overall, these commits focused on improving code organization, adding tests, and updating the configuration file to enhance code quality and maintainability.
